Ghost represents the first step in creating a comprehensive Zero-Knowledge service for the Internet Computer ecosystem. The vision extends beyond the current implementation to create a privacy-preserving infrastructure layer that can be used across a wide range of applications.

Our mission is to make privacy technology accessible to everyone by:

1. Simplifying complex cryptographic concepts through intuitive interfaces
2. Providing AI-enhanced explanations that demystify zero-knowledge technology
3. Creating building blocks for developers to integrate privacy features into their own applications
4. Establishing standards for private attestations on the Internet Computer

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape where data privacy concerns continue to grow, Ghost aims to empower users with the tools to maintain control over their sensitive information while still participating fully in the digital economy.
