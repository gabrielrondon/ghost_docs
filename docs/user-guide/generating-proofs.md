Once your wallet is connected, you can generate a Zero-Knowledge Proof of token ownership:

1. In the main interface, locate the "ZK Proof Generator" card
2. Select the token you want to create a proof for (currently only ICP is supported)
3. Click the "Generate ZK Proof" button
4. The application will create a cryptographic proof, which may take a few seconds
5. When complete, you'll see a dialog with your proof details
6. The dialog includes:
   - Proof ID: A unique identifier for this proof
   - Shareable Link: A URL that can be shared with others to verify the proof
   - Token: The token this proof is for
   - Generated At: Timestamp of proof creation
   - AI-Enhanced Summary: A plain-language explanation of what the proof demonstrates

### Sharing Proofs

To share your proof with someone else:

1. From the proof result dialog, click the "Share Proof" button to copy the shareable link
2. Send this link to the person who needs to verify your token ownership
3. When they open the link, they'll be able to verify your proof without seeing your actual balance

Alternatively, you can copy just the Proof ID by clicking the copy button next to it, and instruct the verifier to enter it manually in the verification page.
