Each successful proof generation and verification includes an AI-enhanced explanation to help understand what the proof demonstrates in plain language.

### Setting Up AI Explanations

To enable AI explanations:

1. Go to the Settings page
2. Navigate to the "API Configuration" tab
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Click "Save Key"

Once configured, AI explanations will be automatically generated when:
- You create a new ZK proof
- You verify a valid proof

### Interpreting AI Summaries

AI summaries typically include:

1. **Brief Summary**: A one-sentence explanation of what the proof demonstrates
2. **Detailed Explanation**: A longer explanation of the proof's significance and how zero-knowledge technology protects privacy

These explanations help non-technical users understand the value and meaning of the cryptographic proof in everyday terms.
