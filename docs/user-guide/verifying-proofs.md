To verify a proof that someone has shared with you:

1. Access the shared verification link, or navigate to the "Verify" page
2. If using a link, the proof will be verified automatically
3. If entering manually, paste the Proof ID in the verification form and click "Verify"
4. The system will check the cryptographic proof and display the result
5. If valid, you'll see:
   - A success message confirming the proof is valid
   - Details about what the proof demonstrates
   - An AI-enhanced explanation of the proof's significance
6. If invalid, you'll see an error message explaining why the verification failed

The verification process confirms that the person owns the specified token without revealing their actual balance or account details.
