3. You will be redirected to the Internet Identity service
4. Authenticate using your preferred method (security key, passphrase, etc.)
5. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected back to Ghost
6. Your wallet will now be connected and your token balances will be displayed

### Plug Wallet

1. Ensure the Plug wallet extension is installed in your browser
2. Navigate to the Ghost application
3. Click on "Connect with Plug Wallet" button
4. A popup from the Plug wallet will appear asking for connection approval
5. Approve the connection request
6. Your wallet will now be connected and your token balances will be displayed

If you don't see the Plug wallet option, you may need to install the Plug browser extension first.
