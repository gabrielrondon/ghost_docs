The AI enhancement layer adds a unique dimension to Ghost, making complex cryptographic operations more accessible to non-technical users. This layer:

1. Takes information about a generated proof
2. Constructs a prompt for the OpenAI API
3. Receives the AI response with a plain-language explanation
4. Presents the explanation to the user alongside the technical proof details

The implementation uses carefully designed prompts to ensure the AI explains the proof accurately while maintaining appropriate security boundaries. The AI never has access to the actual proof data or user's private information.
